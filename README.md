# Day I found out Python is not the snake


I knew this world I live in is
Full of lies But I never imagined

I would encounter these entities off light that guide me through dark.

The world is so full of wonders!
All that while, we were told pyhton was type of huge snake!
Python is no snake, python is an enormous challenge awaiting the "theano 16"
